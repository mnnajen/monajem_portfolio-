## Project description 
The "Car Sales Data" dataset is a tabular dataset that contains 2,500,000 rows of information on car sales from a car dealership over the course of a year. The dataset includes nine columns of data for each car sale. The first column, "Date," represents the date on which the car sale was made. The second column, "Salesperson," provides the name of the salesperson who made the sale. The third column, "Customer Name," provides the name of the customer who purchased the car.

The next three columns relate to the car that was sold. "Car Make" indicates the make of the car that was purchased, such as Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevrolet, or Nissan. "Car Model" indicates the model of the car that was purchased, such as Corolla, Civic, F-150, Silverado, or Altima. "Car Year" indicates the year of the car that was purchased, ranging from 2010 to 2022.

The "Sale Price" column represents the sale price of the car in USD. The next column, "Commission Rate," indicates the commission rate paid to the salesperson on the sale, ranging from 0.05 to 0.15. Finally, the "Commission Earned" column provides the amount of commission earned by the salesperson on the sale.

This dataset is useful for analyzing car sales trends over time and evaluating the performance of individual salespeople in the dealership. It can also be used for predicting sales performance and analyzing the impact of different factors on car sales, such as car make, model, year, and salesperson performance.

##### Total sales by company 

<img width="386" alt="total sales by company" src="https://github.com/mnnajen/monajem_portfolio-/assets/155858665/ff7cfd8b-dbb3-4f1c-9c1b-3af0eeee61e5">

The bar graph shows the total sales by five different companies: Honda, Chevrolet, Toyota, Ford, and Nissan. Here's the interpretation of the data:

1- Honda has the highest sales amounting to $15,036,898,624.
2- Chevrolet is slightly behind Honda, with sales totaling $15,021,372,800.
3- Toyota is the third, with sales of $15,005,405,240.
4- Ford is in fourth place with sales totaling $14,990,661,833.
5- Nissan has the least sales among the listed companies, amounting to $14,976,108,358.

This graph provides a snapshot of sales data at a point in time, and trends over time are also crucial for making informed recommendations. It's important for each company to analyze historical data and trends to understand their trajectory and the effectiveness of their strategies.

##### sales trend over months 

<img width="696" alt="sales trend" src="https://github.com/mnnajen/monajem_portfolio-/assets/155858665/0f2e8591-9cdd-4cc5-8f6a-5adc6877c4cd">

1- The line graph  shows the sales trend over months for five car makers: Chevrolet, Ford, Honda, Nissan, and Toyota from May 2022 to May 2023.
From May 2022 to around January 2023, all companies show relatively stable sales trends, with very little variation month-to-month. The sales figures for all companies seem to be hovering around the $1,000,000,000 mark.

2- There is a noticeable decline in sales starting around February 2023, which becomes quite steep as it approaches May 2023.

For the company that experienced the sales drop, it's especially urgent to conduct a deep analysis of the factors leading to the decrease and to develop immediate strategies to counteract this trend. For the others, while the stability is good, they should prepare for potential market changes that could affect their sales in the future.
